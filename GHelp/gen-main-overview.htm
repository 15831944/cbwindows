<P>
The CyberBoard board gaming system makes playing board games by mail and 
electronic mail a more enjoyable experience. The system allows one to easily
graphically design the various parts of a board game on your computer. The
players can make their moves and exchange recorded versions of the moves
with their opponents. The opponent can then play back the moves. Although 
many types of games may be created using CyberBoard, games that use counters
or chits such as wargames work particularly well. </P>
<P>
CyberBoard is not an artificial opponent. It provides no artificial 
intelligence capability. </P>
