<H1>How Hidden Pieces Work</H1>
<H2>First some teminology is needed.</H2>
<P>
When you create pieces in the game designer program you can 
chose one or two images for pieces. There is a FRONT tile image 
and an optional BACK image. </P>
<P>
When you play a game with two sided pieces a piece has a 
normally visible TOP side and the face down BOTTOM side.</P>
<P>
IMPORTANT RULE:   If a piece is considered hidden (for 
whatever reason) during game play the FRONT image is displayed. 
This is true regardless of what image of piece is on TOP.</P>
<P>
You also need to understand the notion of game players. 
Players can OWN things used in a game. I'll cleverly call 
them the OWNERs. The following things can be OWNed (or not 
OWNed) when playing in CyberBoard's multiplayer mode:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Piece TRAYs</LI>
<LI>Playing BOARDs</LI>
<LI>Pieces</LI>
</UL>
<P>
IMPORTANT RULE:  The OWNERship of a BOARD or a TRAY cannot
be changed in a game. The OWNERship of pieces can change.</P>
<P>
IMPORTANT RULE:  If a TRAY or BOARD is OWNed, then all the 
pieces residing in or on them are automatically set to be 
OWNed by that TRAY or BOARD's OWNER.</P>
<P>
IMPORTANT RULE: Pieces in non-OWNed TRAYs cannot be OWNed 
by anyone. Those pieces will have their OWNERship 
automatically cleared.</P>
<P>
IMPORTANT RULE: Pieces on non-OWNed BOARDs can either be 
OWNed or not OWNed. Non-OWNed BOARDs will probably be where 
most of the action takes place.</P>
<P>
Therefore, non-OWNERs of pieces will only see the FRONT 
tile image of them during play. OWNERs will see whatever 
image is on TOP.</P>

<H2>Visibility of Tray Content</H2>

Trays have several visibility rules available:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Both sides of pieces are fully visible</LI>
<LI>Only the top side of pieces are visible</LI>
<LI>Each piece image is hidden. (shows "HIDDEN")</LI>
<LI>All piece items hidden. (shows the text "ALL HIDDEN")</LI>
</OL>
<P>
I'll call these the TRAY VISIBILITY RULES.</P>
<P>
If a TRAY is OWNed by the current player, then rule (1) 
is used *unless* the "Visibility rule also applies to 
the tray's owner" option is checked.</P>
<P>
If a TRAY is OWNed but not by the current player, then the 
TRAY VISIBILITY RULES are used.</P>
<P>
If a TRAY isn't OWNed by anyone, then the TRAY VISIBILITY 
RULES are used.</P>

<H2>Security of Pieces, Boards, and Trays</H2>

<P>
There is a single option which selects how secure TRAYs, 
BOARDs, and PIECES are from your opponents. The Option 
is set in either the BOARD properties or the TRAY properties 
dialogs. The checkbox option is:</P>
<P>
"Allow non-owners to access pieces on this board/tray."</P>
<P>
I'll call this the ACCESS OPTION.</P>
<P>
If the ACCESS OPTION is cleared for OWNed TRAYs and BOARDs, 
those BOARDs and TRAYs are completely inaccessable to Non-OWNERs. 
They operate normally for the OWNers. If the ACCESS OPTION is 
set for this case, then only the visibility rules are enforced.</P>
<P>
If the ACCESS OPTION is cleared for non-OWNed BOARDs, then 
pieces that are OWNed by players other than the current player 
cannot selected or otherwise affected. If the ACCESS OPTION is 
set for this case, then only the visibility rules are enforced.</P>

<H2>Some Miscellaneous Information</H2>

<P>
If a move affects a piece in a manner that should be hidden 
from view, the move is played back SILENTLY. The opponent is 
not be aware anything happened. The following operations performed 
on OWNed pieces will not be seen by your opponent:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Flipping a piece over</LI>
<LI>Setting a piece's text</LI>
<LI>Locking or unlocking a Piece</LI>
</UL>

<P>
At times it can be confusing to know what your opponent can actually see
since you, as the owner, see quite a bit more. To see the boards and trays
from the perspective of a game spectator use the 
<b><a href="gp-ref-menu-view.htm">View/Simulate Specator Player</a></b> 
menu command.</P>

<H2>Creating a Board Resident Non-Owned Decks of Cards</H2>

<P>
In CyberBoard cards are simply pieces.</P>
<P>
If you need a deck of cards that reside on a BOARD (rather 
than in a TRAY) and aren't owned by any player, a special option 
has been added to assist in this situation. Basically what 
is needed is that when a non-OWNed card is selected on a BOARD or 
viewed in a TRAY, the BOTTOM information should NOT be visible. 
The checkbox option is specified when a piece is created and reads 
as follows:</P>
<P>
"Only show top image during games."</P>
<P>
IMPORTANT RULE: This rule is only enforced if a piece is 
not OWNed. You can force the rule to apply to everyone including
OWNERs by checking the following companion option:</P>
<P>
"Enforce above option for owned pieces too."</P>

<H2>How to Create a Multiplayer Game</H2>

<P>
First you need to create a multiplayer Scenario. This is done
using the menu command <b><a href="gp-ref-menu-project.htm">Project/Create Players...</a></b>. 
If this is set to a non-zero value, the Scenario is considered to be 
multiplayer and supports hidden units. </P>
<P>
You can change the default player names using the menu command
<b><a href="gp-ref-menu-project.htm">Project/Edit Players...</a></b>.</P>
<P>
Set ownership and security on various TRAYs and BOARDs as 
required.</P>
<P>
Create a game as you normally would and select the multiplayer
scenario file. First you will be given the opportunity to change 
the player names to real names. Press Ok. Next you select a 
base filename for the game. This name will be the root part of 
all the generated player files. When you press Ok the player 
files are created. The following files will be created:</P>

<UL>
<LI><code>RootFilename-&lt;Player_Name&gt;.gam</code>. One of these will be 
  created for each player in the game. These should be
  EMailed to the appropriate players.</LI>

<LI><code>RootFilename-Spectator.gam</code>. This file has no OWNERship access
  rights. It can be sent to spectators who will observe the game.</LI>

<LI><code>RootFilename-Referee.gam</code>. This file has total rights. Generally
  the Referee for a game should only have this file. This game file
  allows access and viewability to everything. It could also be used
  for "power" spectators who would like to look over the shoulder
  of all other players.</LI>
