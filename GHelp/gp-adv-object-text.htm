<H1>How Piece/Marker Text Works</H1>
<P>
Pieces and markers can have multi-line text associated with them. 
To see the text you allow the mouse pointer to hover over the unit
for a moment. If the balloon tips annoy you, they can be
turned off using the <b><a href="gp-ref-menu-view.htm">View/Show Object Text Tips</a></b> 
menu command.</p>
<P>
Two sided playing pieces store a different text item for each side of the
piece.</P>
<P>
When pieces or markers that have text are visible in lists 
(i.e., the select list or in a tray), an asterisk character is 
displayed to the left of the list item.</P>
<P>
To set text for a piece or marker on a board or in a tray first
select just a single object. You can't set or edit text for more 
than one object at a time. Right click on the item and choose the
<b><a href="gp-ref-menu-edit.htm#objtext">Edit Object Text</a></b> command. 
In many cases simply double clicking 
on the object will also display the dialog.</P>
<P>
If a piece is double sided you can set the text for both sides at once.
Just check the "Set text on both sides of pieces" check box. Otherwise
you will only be setting the text for the current topmost face of the piece.</P>
<P>
Markers have a special option available to them that cause a text
entry dialog to pop-up when the marker is created. This could be
used for easy entry of post-it style notes on a game board. This
option is set in the create marker dialog.</P>
<P>
Another good trick is to create transparent markers that are used
to annotate areas of the map. Set the text prompt option so you 
can enter the text before losing track of the marker. You can
also lock the marker so it can't be selected to create permanent
annotated hot zones.</P>
