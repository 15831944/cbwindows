<H1>How to Use CyberBoard</H1>
<h2>Create a GameBox File</h2>
<p>
Use the game designer program to create a GameBox file. A GameBox
contains all the playing boards, game pieces and annotation graphics 
(called markers) used in a game. This is the major portion of the work
of using CyberBoard. Once the GameBox is created it may be used to create
many different game scenarios.</p>
<P>
The following procedure is used to create a GameBox file:</P>

<p><i>TO BE ADDED</i></p>

<H2>Setup a Game for Play</H2>

<p>Use the game player program to create a game scenario file. The game 
scenario contains:</p>
<UL>
<LI>Playing piece tray definitions. Trays hold pieces that are not on
    the playing board. For instance, if your game is checkers, a tray could
    be used to hold king pieces and pieces removed from play. Alternately, 
    the game designer could have placed a "King" image on the backside 
    of the playing piece.</LI>
<LI>Pieces placed on the board in their starting positions. For the game
    of checkers they would be placed in their standard positions.</LI>
</UL>
<p>
The steps to creating a scenario file are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Using the <code>CBPlay</code> program, create a Scenario file. 
    All games start from a scenario file. To create a scenario 
    use menu command <b><a href="gp-ref-menu-file.htm">File/New</a></b> and 
    select Scenario. You'll be prompted to select the GameBox file
    that the scenario is associated with.</li> 
<li>Next, use menu command <b><a href="gp-ref-menu-project.htm">Project/Select 
    Playing Boards</a></b> to select the boards that are going to used in your scenario. 
    This selection process is to mimic the fact that some games come with more
    than one playing board--only a few of which are used.</li>
<li>Now create trays to hold playing pieces. Use menu command 
    <b><a href="gp-ref-menu-project.htm">Project/CreatePlaying Piece Tray</a></b>.
    Create any combination of trays that makes sense for your game. In
    the case of the example generic game there is one for the red army and one for
    the blue army.</li>
<li>Transfer the pieces this scenario will use into the trays. To do this, 
    select one of the trays in the <a href="gp-ref-window-gsn-project.htm">
    main project window</a> and press the Edit button. You'll be presented 
    with a dialog that is used to transfer pieces from the GameBox 
    playing piece groups into the trays.</li>
<li>Finally, set up the game's starting situation for the game by dragging
    pieces from the trays onto the playing board. Move them around etc.</li>
<li>Close the file.</li>
</ol>
<p>You're ready to play the game.</p>
<H2>Playing a Game</H2>
<ol>
<li>Use the menu command <b><a href="gm-ref-menu-file.htm">File/New</a></b> and select 
    <b>Game</b>. You'll be prompted for the scenario file which defines the 
    starting setup for the game. You can now start playing. The game automatically 
    records your moves, messages, etc. </li>
<li>When you're ready to send the moves to your opponent select the menu 
    command <b><a href="gp-ref-menu-file.htm">
    File/Send Recorded Moves to File</a></b>. E-Mail this file to your
    opponent.</li>
<li>When you get a move file from your opponent, use the menu command 
    <b><a href="gp-ref-menu-file.htm">File/Load Recorded Move File</a></b> to load it. 
    Use commands on the <b><a href="gp-ref-menu-playback.htm">Playback</a></b> menu 
    to do the playback. When you're done, accept the move file and it'll be added 
    to your game history. Keep exchanging move files in the same manner.</li>
</ol>
