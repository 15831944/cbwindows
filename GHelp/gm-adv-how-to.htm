<p>The following are various tips and tricks that don't warrant
a topic on their own.</p>

<h2>How to display a different board bitmap at each board viewing scale.</h2>

Use the <b><a href="gm-ref-menu-tools.htm">Tools/Set Scale Visibility</a></b> 
feature to do this. The procedure in more detail:

<ol>
    <li>Create the full scale map and use the CyberBoard palette to create a
        compatible image. Paste this into the playing board.</li>
    <li>Open the <b>Set Scale Visibility</b> dialog and clear all scale
        check marks except full-scale. You will now only see this bitmap
        when the board is viewed at full-scale.</li>
    <li>Open the board properties dialog and make note of the pixel dimensions
        of the half and small scale boards. These are the target sizes you should
        use when creating your reduced scale maps.</li>
    <li>Set the board scale to half-scale and paste the half-scale bitmap into the
        playing board. Note: it will initially seem too small.</li>
    <li>Open the <b>Set Scale Visibility</b> dialog and check the 
        "Above scale is natural scale" and "Half Scale" check boxes.</li>
    <li>Set the board scale to small-scale and paste the small-scale bitmap into the
        playing board. Note: it will initially seem too small.</li>
    <li>Open the <b>Set Scale Visibility</b> dialog and check the 
        "Above scale is natural scale" and "Small Scale" check boxes.</li>
</ol>
