<H1>How Object Locking Works</H1>

<P>
Pieces and markers can be locked to the board's surface. When an object
is locked it is impossible to select it. It's as if the object is part
of the original board design.</P>
<P>
Objects can be locked while in either Scenario or Game mode.</P>
<p>
To use the locking feature first select the objects you wish to lock.
Then use the <b><a href="gp-ref-menu-actions.htm">Actions/Lock Objects</a></b> 
menu command. The objects will be locked and deselected.</p>
<p>
If you need to unlock a piece you would first deactivate the locks with the
<b><a href="gp-ref-menu-actions.htm">Actions/Suspend Object Locks</a></b> 
menu command. This gives you access to <i>all</i>
locked object on the board. Then select the objects you wish to 
unlock and use the <b>Actions/Lock Objects</b> to unlock them. Finally
reactivate the locks with the "Actions/Suspend Object Locks" menu command.

<p>Some possible applications of this feature are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customizing a board's terrain prior to play.</li>
<li>Building tile based maps.</li>
<li>Build RoboRally like boards from smaller map pieces.</li>
<li>Locking down pieces you don't accidentally want moved.</li>
<li>Adding board annotations during play that you don't want to be selected.</li>
</ul>
