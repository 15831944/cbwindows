<H2>Font</H2>

<p>Use this dialog to set the current font for the currently selected editor window.</p>

<H2><a name="tofront">Bring Objects to Front <img src="images/gm-btn-tools-tofront.png" align="absmiddle"></H2>

<p>Moves the selected objects to the front of the drawing list. The objects
will then appear to be above objects that aren't selected.</p>

<H2><a name="toback">Send Objects to Back <img src="images/gm-btn-tools-toback.png" align="absmiddle"></H2>

<p>Moves the selected objects to the back of the drawing list. The objects
will then appear to be below objects that aren't selected.</p>

<H2>Draw Objects Above Grid</H2>

<P>If this item is checked, the selected objects are rendered as a final
pass over the top of the hex grid. It's a kind of pseudo-fourth
drawing layer. This is very useful for placing tables and the like over the
grid lines.</p>

<H2>Set Scale Visibility</H2>

<p>This dialog is used to control at what board scale views (full, half, or small) 
the selected objects will be visible. The dialog can also be used to force a bitmap
image to be rendered at its standard pixel size at a single board scale.</p>

<H2>Suspend Scale Visibility</H2>

<p>This command suspends enforcement of the options selected by the <b>Set Scale Visibility</b>
menu command.</p>

<H2><a name="snap">Snap Grid <img src="images/gm-btn-tools-snap.png" align="absmiddle"></H2>

<p>This command toggles the use of the snap grid. You can also temporarily suspend the 
snap grid by holding the <b>Ctrl</b> key while you are dragging an object.</p>

<H2>Board Properties</H2>

<p>Presents the board properties dialog for the currently selected board editor view. </p>

<H2>Drawing Tools Are Sticky</H2>

<p>If this option is checked, the currently selected drawing tool will remain selected
after the drawing operation is completed. Otherwise, the selection tool is automatically
selected.</p>

<H2>Update Tile Changes</H2>

<p>This command applies the current tile edits to the master copy of the tile. You cannot
undo this operation.</p>

<H2>Discard Tile Changes</H2>

<p>This command discards the edits of the current tile. You cannot undo this operation.</p>
       
<H2>Rotate Tile</H2>

<p>Rotates the currently selected tile by a multiple of 90 degrees.</p>
        
<H2>Resize Tile</H2>

<p>Use this command to resize the currently selected tile.</p>

<H2>Apply Cell Mask to Tile</H2>

<p>This command draws a hex shaped masked area on the currently selected 
tile. It's used to make it easier to see what areas of the tile are actually
displayed when placed in a hex grid cell.</p>

<H2>Tile Image Tools</H2>
