<H1>How Geomorphic Boards Work</H1>

<P>
Before you can use the geomorphic board construction feature
you must follow a few rules. But first some terminology.</P>

<P>
The GRAIN of boards using hex cell styles is either vertical
or horizontal. If your hex cells have a horizontal line on an
edge then that board has a vertical GRAIN. This corresponds to
the "Hex (Flat Up)" board creation option.</P>

<P>
If your hex cells have a vertical line on an edge then that 
board has a horizontal GRAIN. This corresponds to the 
"Hex (Point Up)" board creation option.</P>

<P>
Here are the rules for creating boards compliant with the
geomorphic board construction feature:</P>

<P>
RULE:  The board must use hexes.</P>

<P>
RULE:  The number of rows/columns in the direction of the
GRAIN *MUST* be odd.</P>

<P>
That's all of them.</P>

<P>
Only boards having the same cell dimensions, orientation, and
stagger option may be combined as a composite board.</P>

<P>
When CyberBoard "stitches" together boards. The half cells that 
join two boards along the grain are graphically merged by taking
the image of the two halves of those cells and creating a special
joining cell (you really don't need to know this but it's kind of 
cool to see).</P>

<P>
New boards are constructed from geomorphically compliant boards
by using the "Create Geomorphic Board" Dialog.</P>

<P>
The left list box in the dialog shows all the boards the are 
geomorphically compliant so you don't have to guess. The  list's 
content is dynamically adjusted during the build process 
so you can only select valid boards for the particular situation.</P>

<P>
Constructing a composite board is done by building an array of other
boards. You add boards along a row until you want to start a new
row. Then you push the "Row break" button. You then add more
boards and so on. The right list box shows the composition.</P>

<P>
The board array must be properly formed before the "Ok" button
is enabled (don't forget you also have to name the board). That is:</P>

<UL>
<LI>All boards in a row must be the same number of cells high.</LI>
<LI>All boards in a column must be the same number of cells wide.</LI>
<LI>All board array cells must have a board. No empty slots are allowed.</LI>
</UL>

<p>
Settings like the snap grid and the base board color are taken from the first
board added to the board array. This means if the first board's base
color is green and another board's base color is blue, the resultant
composite board's base color will be green. The blue color is ignored. Please
plan for this when you create the component geomorphic boards.</p>

<p>
There is no capability to flip a board 180 degrees. This means you have to create
two boards to actually be able to use both orientations of a component board in
the resulting composite board.</p>
